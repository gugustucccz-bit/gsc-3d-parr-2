// Every haptic the game plays, by name.
//
// THIS FILE IS A FIXED CONTRACT. FreeMilk reads it to list the game's haptics, and
// it is written by the set_haptic and remove_haptic tools — not by hand.
//
// An effect is a pattern: events on a timeline, in seconds.
//   type       'transient' (an instantaneous tap) or 'continuous' (a buzz)
//   time       when it fires, relative to the start
//   intensity  0-1, how hard it hits
//   sharpness  0-1, a dull thud at 0, a crisp tick at 1
//   duration   continuous events only, seconds
//
// Events also take an envelope — attackTime, decayTime, releaseTime,
// sustained. A pattern may carry curves that ramp intensity or sharpness
// smoothly, and may loop, set a playbackRate, or be sustained so the game can
// change it while it runs.
//
// There is no web haptics API on iOS: this goes through the app to the Taptic
// Engine, so it does nothing when the game is opened in a plain browser.
